# @ilokesto/form

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- 0fa1cb0: Port legacy post-import form fixes and features into the monorepo.

  - Add MIT `LICENSE` file and include `LICENSE`/`README.md`/`README.ko.md` in the published `files` list; correct the README private/publishConfig statement.
  - Add `isFocused: boolean` to `FieldState`. `form.focus(path)` now sets `isFocused: true` instead of being a no-op. `form.blur(path)` always clears `isFocused` regardless of `validateOn`. `FormArrayRebaser` carries `isFocused` across `move`/`swap`/`insert`/`remove`. `FormStateSummary` gains `focusedField: string | null` (first focused field in `Object.entries` order, or `null`). React/Vue/Solid `useFormState` return types expose `focusedField`.
  - Add reactive `values`/`resetOptions` support to the Vue adapter via `VueFormOptions<TValues>` with `values?: MaybeRefOrGetter<TValues>`. When `values` changes by reference, the adapter calls `form.reset(values, resetOptions)`, mirroring the React adapter.
  - Make async validation target-aware. Independent fields can validate concurrently, overlapping work becomes stale, and submit retries against the latest value snapshot before invoking `onValid`.
  - Add `useField` to the Svelte adapter as a breaking `Readable<SvelteFieldSnapshot>` surface with `props` and `setValue`; consume field state through `$field` or `get(field)`.
  - Export `VueFormOptions` from `@ilokesto/form/vue` and align Vue binding event/value types with `v-bind` contracts.
  - Add core unit tests for `ValueHelper`, `FormPath`, `FormStateInitializer`, `FormArrayMutationPlanner`, and `FormArrayRebaser`.
  - Build importable ESM and declarations with tsup, verify all public subpaths from an isolated packed consumer, and include all examples in the root workspace build/typecheck graph.
  - Document ESM-only policy, PathKey encoding performance considerations, and immer bundle size considerations in README (EN/KO).
  - Add Vue/Solid/Svelte login and React validation flow examples.

- dc598b5: Rebuild the shared state foundation with synchronous FIFO commit-snapshot
  notifications, immediate subscription disposal, independent callback registrations,
  and aggregated delivery errors. These are intentional observable changes from
  recursive, fail-fast notification delivery.

  Expose structural ReadableStore and StoreApi contracts, createStore, and explicit
  set/update operations. State now exports framework-neutral construction and
  composition from its root, createReducer handles, and bind/bindReducer entrypoints
  for React, Vue, Solid, Svelte, and Angular. Existing convenience creators share the
  same foundation, and Svelte set now stores callable values without invoking them.
  Reducer results also preserve callable value identity, and handles retain the
  capability types of an explicitly supplied Store.

  Migrate Form, Overlay, and Toast to the new Store construction surface; Modal
  inherits Overlay's updated notification foundation. Preserve framework support,
  middleware ordering, reducer metadata, SSR snapshots, and package capabilities.
  Packed Form verification inherits the root pnpm version so its local Store
  tarball override is honored in isolated consumer projects.

  See the bilingual State advanced migration guide and Store notification semantics.
  Version application and publishing are intentionally left to a later Changesets run.

### Minor Changes

- 05f02b2: Add reference-based reactive `values` and value-driven `resetOptions` contracts for the React, Vue, Solid, and Svelte adapters.

### Patch Changes

- 1e02b6c: Introduce Changesets for automated versioning and changelog management
- b7e264c: Serialize concurrent submit validation and callbacks so every submission settles without validation-token livelock.
- 6819f03: Align form documentation with the actual public contract: use `defaultValues` (not the non-existent `initialValues`) in all examples and prose, and document only the types the root entrypoint actually exports. `FieldState` and `FormState` are now described as runtime shapes returned by `getFieldState()` and `getState()`, not as root imports.
- 31b4ba6: Preserve stable render keys for sibling and structurally surviving nested arrays when another array is mutated.
- bb26d48: Point package repository links to the ilokesto organization monorepo and update the fetcher homepage before retiring the legacy repositories.
